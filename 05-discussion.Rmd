# Discussion

Visualisation methods have improved in iterations over many years. Cartograms showed great promise and several algorithms were presented to create cartograms in the 1960s and 1970s.
The introduction of computer assisted cartogram techniques were developed in the 1970s and 1980s. Dorling [@TVSSS], [@ACTUC] introduced several alternative visualisation methods and their use has had a profound impact in the communication of data with population related distributions.
Nusrat and Kobourov provide examples for techniques to evaulate the statistical, geographical, and topological accuracy of alternative visualisation displays.
