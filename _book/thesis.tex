The Australian population has congregated in the capital cities and significant cities in each state. This pattern has resulted in very dense population centers and sparsely populated rural areas. The relationship between the Australian population and the geographic area they live in results in a heterogeneous distribution of the map space. The goal of many spatial visualisations is to gain a broad perspective of the values of statistics over the Australian population. However, the use of most mapping techniques can mislead, as the use of geographical areas unequally presents the spatial distribution of a dataset.

As part of this thesis, an algorithm is presented which will take geospatial areas in the form of polygons and create an alternative graphical display of a spatial distribution. This algorithm takes a set of polygons and creates a map of tessellated hexagons, representing a single geographical area with a single hexagon. It arranges them to replicate spatial relationships of geographic areas in each city. The hexagon tile map visualisation produced by the algorithm is contrasted with the traditional choropleth map.
The package \texttt{sugarbag} \autocite{sugarbag} implements the algorithm for the statistical software \texttt{R} \autocite{R}.

Using animations will allow us to control how people transform a recognisable map of Australia, or the cities within, into a more reliable map for inference. Animation is gaining popularity as access to computing power is increasing the amount of applications.

\chapter{Introduction}\label{ch:intro}}

There are many visualisation methods used to present geospatial data. The design of the visualisation chosen can hinder or improve the communication of the spatial distribution. A choropleth map is the most common display used to present geographical data. Maps contribute to understanding spatial distributions of disease occurrence, and locating disease clusters. Disease data is often aggregated by political areas. One reason for this is privacy and another is the responsibility on the political entity to respond. The typical visualisation for aggregated spatial data is a choropleth map, where areas are coloured by the numerical value.

Choropleth maps do a disservice to the map reader, as the attention of the map user is distributed according to the size of the area. Using a choropleth map to get a broad perspective of Australia can be misleading, when the use of geographical areas misrepresents the spatial distribution of a dataset. This is not practical if each area is considered equally important. In AustCaralia, the population is not equally dispersed across the geographic map base.
Instead, the communities are densely populated in the inner city areas, especially around the capital cities. There are several visualisation methods that have been developed to emphasise the population dense areas. These alternatives should be considered when planning the communication of geospatial statistics, visualisations should be chosen to best represent the spatial distribution. The work is motivated by the Australian Cancer Atlas,
which presents the spatial patterns of many cancers in Australia. The aim of this thesis is to contribute an algorithm that creates effective visualisations for the communication of geospatial population statistics.

\hypertarget{the-australian-cancer-atlas}{%
\section{The Australian Cancer Atlas}\label{the-australian-cancer-atlas}}

This work was motivated by the Australian Cancer Atlas (ACA), an online, interactive web tool for exploring the impact of cancer on Australian communities. The prominent display used by the ACA is a visualisation of incidence rates or excess death rates. The set of geographic units used is Australian Statisical Areas, at Level 2 (SA2s). There are almost 2,200 individual SA2s.

The choropleth map used in the ACA is familiar to the general public of Australia. It is appropriate to use this display as users can orient themselves on the map base and find geographic areas relevant to them.
However, when the intention of the map user is to convey the whole spatial distribution the information derived visually from the colours can be misleading.
The rural areas are over emphasised, and the densely populated inner city areas are not given enough attention.

\hypertarget{visual-inference}{%
\section{Visual Inference}\label{visual-inference}}

Visual inference will be used to determine if the communication of population geospatial statistics is more effective when using an alternative display.
Buja et al \autocite{GIIV} provide the `lineup' protocol as a formal framework for testing visual statistical methods. Implementing this framework will allow new alternative visualisation method to be tested.

The lineup protocol will be used to test if a visualisation is effective, a visualisation displaying a real population based distribution can be hidden in a collection of visualisations that display null distributions \autocite{chowd}.
It takes inspiration from a police lineup.
The witness in this regard is a participant recruited from a crowdsource platform, such as Figure-Eight.
The visualisation containing a real distribution is considered the `accused'.
It is put in a lineup of innocent displays that do not show a real population based distribution.
If the `witness' chooses the `accussed' as different from the innocent plots, it can be considered that there is a specific pattern displayed that is not present in the others.
In this protocol, the null hypothesis can be rejected in favour of the alternative when it is chosen in the lineup. The null hypothesis fails to be rejected when it is not selected in the linup.

\hypertarget{aims-and-objectives}{%
\section{Aims and Objectives}\label{aims-and-objectives}}

This work aims to provide a solution to presenting geospatial data regarding populations.
It considers the visualisation methods developed over the past two centuries that shift the focus from the geographic map base.

\item
  \emph{Devising an Algorithm for creating hexagon tile maps of Australia:} The algorithm will take geospatial areas and create an alternative visualisation of the spatial distribution.
\item
  \emph{Test the effectiveness of the hexagon tile map relative to the choropleth map:} The hexagon tile map produced by the algorithm will be contrasted with the traditional choropleth map, applying the same colour methods to represent the data. The maps will be used in an experiment to test the effectiveness by asking for users to spot spatial distributions.
\item
  \emph{Communicating the relationship between the hexmap and choropleth map through animation:} Maximise the benefits of both displays when communicating to the public. The use of animations may control how people follow a recognisable map of Australia into an alternative visualisation for inference.

This chapter discusses the use of the choropleth map in presenting spatial data.
It discusses the hexagon tile map algorithm contributed by this thesis and discusses its similarities and differences from other alternative visualisation methods.
It discusses the use of the visual inference study for evaluating the displays produced by the hexagon tile map algorithm for Australia. Finally, it discusses how animating between a choropleth and hexagon display can allow map creators to direct the attention of users to the overlooked, small but densely populated geographic areas.

\hypertarget{presenting-spatial-data}{%
\section{Presenting spatial data}\label{presenting-spatial-data}}

Choropleth map displays are the traditional, and current practice method for presenting geospatial data. The use of familiar geographic polygons allows users to readily find areas of interest on the map display \autocite{EI}. The spatial patterns among the areas are revealed via the colour used to fill each geographic area.

Cancer Atlases are used to develop hypotheses about spatial distributions of cancer statistics \autocite{CPISACA}. Hot spots with high values can be detected by dramatic changes in colour between neighbours \autocite{MACM}.

However, when used as a tool communicate spatial distributions the use of the choropleth map may lead to misinterpretation of the overall distribution. This is because of the overemphasis on the large geographic areas, and the lack of visibility for the small inner-city communities \autocite{ACTUC}.

Visualisation methods have improved in iterations over many years. Cartograms \autocite{ACCAC} showed great promise and several algorithms were presented to create cartograms in the 1960s and 1970s. Cartogram techniques highlighted the population by expanding the map area of densely populated communities.
The introduction of computer assisted cartogram techniques were developed in the 1970s and 1980s. Dorling \autocite{TVSSS}, \autocite{ACTUC} introduced several alternative visualisation methods and their use has had a profound impact in the communication of data with population related distributions. These displays enabled viewers to physically see the densely populated areas and avoid spending attention on less populated, but geographically large map areas \autocite{CTTMB}.

\hypertarget{the-hexagon-tile-map-algorithm}{%
\section{The hexagon tile map algorithm}\label{the-hexagon-tile-map-algorithm}}

A key aim of this thesis was to present an algorithm for displaying geospatial data. The algorithm presented in chapter algorithm is the result of many iterations in the process necessary to transform geographic areas into a tessellated hexagon tile map.

The tesselation employed in the hexagon tile map algorithm maintains connectedness between neighbouring areas, this draws inspiration from contiguous cartograms \autocite{ACA}, rectangular cartograms \autocite{RSCW} and Dorling's circular cartograms \autocite{ACTUC}. However, the hexagon tile map algorithm does not employ the gravitation pull mathematics that is used to create contiguous cartograms. It also does not iterate on the placement of hexagons.\\
The choice of the haxgon, a consistent shape used for all areas, also draws from rectangular and Dorling cartograms. This encourages map readers to focus on the similarities or difference in the colour between geographic neighbours, and does not distract them with unfamiliar boundaries after a contiguous cartogram transformation.

The hexagon tile map display is least like the non-contiguous cartogram \autocite{NAC} which maintains the familiar geographic shapes. Some similarity in the final results may occur as densely populated regions maintain connectivity with neighbours, and sparsely populated areas will use the underlying white map space to separate neighbours.

The implementation of the \texttt{sugarbag} \autocite{sugarbag} package for R \autocite{R} provides map creators the opportunity to apply the algorithm to any set of geospatial polygons. This does not require manual creation of grids, but the displays are reuable for any populated related data set that uses the same set of geographic units.

\hypertarget{visual-inference-study-1}{%
\section{Visual inference study}\label{visual-inference-study-1}}

Conducting a visual inference study allowed a contrast of the traditional choropleth display to the alternative hexagon tile map.

The visual inference study showed that the hexagon tile map display is a valid alternative as participants acheived higher detection rates for the hexagon tile map when presenting the geographic spatial distribution and the population related distributions.

\hypertarget{animating-between-displays}{%
\section{Animating between displays}\label{animating-between-displays}}

Interactivity can allow greater detail to be drawn about small neighbourhoods in a choropleth map. By zooming in, the same shapes shown on the initial map become much larger and comparisons between immediate neighbours becomes simpler.
Interacting can also allow the map user to drive their exploration. In the case of the Australian Cancer Atlas, the interactive tools allow quick comparisons between areas far from each other on the map. It also allows quick comparisons of the estimated cancer statistics by showing the colours for each cancer type in a table-like display. These additiions allow user driven exploration, but do not guarantee that the spatial distibution across the country is digested accurately.

Animating between a choropleth and a hexagon tile map will allows map users to understand how the small communities of a whole country are affected simultaneously. It also teaches map users how to find areas of interest as their attention is drawn to the capital cities, that may not have caught their attention in the display of the choropleth map. When communicating cancer statistics, there should be a balance between providing people a familiar landscape and ensuring the interpret the spatial distribution correctly. A directed exploration of a collection of inner city neighbourhoods will take the distiribution out of context, the Australian Cancer Atlas provides some visual tools to combat this by highlighting that the areas displayed are only subsets However, allowing the values of an inner-city neighbourhood to be visible in the context of all other areas will enhance the understanding of the spatial distribution. Animations will communicate a specific message trhough the capture and direction of users' attention.

The animations created of the Australian Statistical Areas at Level 2, used in the Australian Cancer Atlas, highlight just how many SA2 areas are hidden due to their size in the choropleth display. The rapid shrinking of the rural areas allows users to recognise the emphasis that had been placed on the large geographic regions.
Their attention is then drawn to the expanding capital cities, and the coastal towns that were not previously visible.

\hypertarget{ch:conclusion}{%
\chapter{Conclusion}\label{ch:conclusion}}

The first aim of this thesis was to present an alternative visualisation method for spatial data. This thesis has provided a new algorithm to present spatial distributions of disease data, and includes an R code \autocite{R} implementation. The spatial data sets that will be effectively communicated by this display will likely have population related distributions. The hexagon tile map display will represent each area equally on the map space to effectively convey the spatial distribution of the set.

The hexagon tile map visualisation method solves the misprepresentation problem of choropleth displays of geographic data sets that contain a substantial amounts of areas. This algorithm is accessible to all R users, in a set of simple functions. It can be applied to any set of areas in an \texttt{sf} \autocite{sf} object.

The tile map allocation provided by the \texttt{allocate} function in the \texttt{sugarbag} package can easily be used to create animations between a choropleth and hexagon tile map display. Linking the familiar geography to the effective display for understanding the distribution across many heterogeneous geographic regions.

The effectiveness of the hexagon tile map has been proved by the visual inference study. It showed that participants could recognise the data display in the set of null distributions more frequently when viewing a hexagon tile map display. The choropleth map display is still effective for distributions that are directly related to the geography, such as the North-West to South-East distribution used in the study.
This has expanded the applications of visual inference studies in a spatial data context.

Future work will include expanding on criteria to evaulate the hexagon tile maps produced by the algorithm. The methods to evaluate the alternative displays have not been thoroughly explored in this thesis.
This framework will be used to create relevant tests that contrast the use of the map area, and changes in the visual statistics when the parameter of the hexagon tile map algorithm are altered.

The current hexagon tile map creates a template map that can be used to visualise any data set that coutains the areas used to create the map.
There is the possibility of allowing a bivariate display to incorpporate uncertainty by using a colour scheme that operates in two directions as suggested by Lucchesi and Wikle \autocite{VUADBC}.
The animation methods that allow colours filling the hexagons to flicker communicate uncertainty could also be employed.

With large hexagons, there is a potential to incorporate geofacets \autocite{IGF} to create a tesselated display of small visualisations for each geographic unit. These displays become increasingly complex if the visualisation becomes more detailed, or the hexagons become smaller.

This work has contributed a new visualisation for spatial data sets. The spatial distributions of cancer burden for different types of cancers largely relates to the population rather than the geography. The alternative visualisation method highlights the communities, and the hexagon tile map may be implemented in future iterations of the Australian Cancer Atlas to improve the communication of spatial patterns of cancer burden on Australian communities. For wide use by map creators and those interested in alternative visual diaplays, the code implementation has been provided to any R user with examples and documentation.
This work has also contributed to the literature of visual inference studies, by using the ``lineup'' protocol developed by Buja et al.~and used by \textcite{GIIV}, and \textcite{GTPCCD}. This example showed there was a difference in the rate of pattern recognition when participants saw competing spatial map displays.

To communicate human related spatial patterns of disease, map creators should consider the use of alternative displays. The hexagon tile map display has proven effective in this thesis for communicating spatial distributions in sets of heterogeneous geographic units. This thesis provides a practical guide for map creators communicating spatial displays of cancer data in Australia.

\section{Overall Performance}\label{overall-performance}}

The detection rate is considered for each lineup. The detection rates for group A were less varied than the detection rates for the lineups seen by group B. Fig. \ref{fig:pdetection-group} shows the distribution using a boxplot. This shows the median value for detection rate was extremely similar.

\includegraphics{thesis_files/figure-latex/pdetection-group-1.pdf}

The overall detection rate is considered for each trend model in Fig. \ref{fig:pdetect-trend}.
The detection rates for the NW-SE trend model was less varied than the detection rates for the Three Cities and All Cities trends. Fig. \ref{fig:pdetection-group} shows the distribution using a boxplot. This shows the distributions of the rates do not overlap for NW-SE and Three Cities trends, the Three cities range was larger, but the median was much higher for the NW-SE trend. The All Cities trend model distribution overlaps with the NW-SE and All Cities trends.

\includegraphics{thesis_files/figure-latex/pdetect-trend-1.pdf}

The boxplots in Fig. \ref{fig:pdetection-type} contrast the distribution of the detection rates for eah type of display.
The detection rates across the lineups was less varied for the hexagon display. There was a large difference in the medians for the types of displays.
Without considering the relationship for each lineup, the hexagon lineup display allowed the participants to achieve higher detection rates.

Each lineup had twelve map displays, this gave participants the choice of any plot, and the choice to not provide a response. this non-reponse is indicated by 0.
The choices made by participants are displayed in Fig. \ref{fig:choices}. The height of each orange lollipop indiates the proportion of participants that selected the map display of real data, they represent the correct choices.
The green lollipops show the proportion of participants that selected the incorrect displays in each lineup.

The proportion of choices are also presented separately for each trend model in Table. \ref{tab:choice-nwse}, Table. \ref{tab:choice-three}, and Table. \ref{tab:choice-all}.
The correct map display in lineups with a North West to South East trend was chosen correctly with much greater frequency.
In the lineups of All Cities displays, participants were misled by the choropleth display, but not the hexagon display for all except (2).
All of Three Cities displays, except (4), were detected in the hexagon display. All except one lineup had at least one participant select the correct map in the lineup as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:choices}.

Participants were recruited via advertising on the Figure-Eight crowdsource platform.
Choosing the task from the list directed all potential participants to the page of instructions.
This page contained written instructions and is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:instruct}.

The participants were trained using three displays. There were relatively simple lineups, they are displayed in Fig. \ref{fig:training1} and Fig. \ref{fig:training2}.

\hypertarget{survey-application}{%
\section{Survey application}\label{survey-application}}

The survey application was a \texttt{shinydashboard} we application, hosted on a website external to the Figure-Eight platform. The link to the survey was located at the bottom of the instructions and training page. Only participants who had read all of the instructions and seen the example image sets continued to the survey via the link.
This page also contained a question that asked participants for a validation code. The participants unique validation code was generated upon them opening the web application. This code was released to participants when they had considered all twelve lineups and submitted their responses to the \texttt{googlesheets} data set. Their validation codes were contained in the data set and associated with each of their responses.

The demographic and consent page of the \texttt{shinydashboard} web application are displayed in Fig. \ref{fig:survey-demogs}. Two example lineups are shown, one choropleth map lineup in Fig. \ref{fig:survey-choro} and one heaxgon tile map lineup in Fig. \ref{fig:survey-hex}.
